		Error vs Exception

package name: day37_exceptions



unexpected event happens it calls exceptions.internet gitti, tekerlek patladi bunlar exceptions

exception occurs during RUNTIME  OR COMPILE TIME

THERE ARE 2 CATAGORIES OF EXCEPTION: checked and uncheck exception

check is:   compile can check and compile give error immidiatly, but its hard with uncheck because compile can not check
and it comes in run time like class cast exception. compile did not show as error it comes when we run time.

uncheck:   Run time / zor/Is a relationshp with runtime Exception(Parent class)
uncheck: String out of bound, class cast exception, null pointer

check:compile time; easy to fix / they do not is A relation with RunTimeException class


to prevent exception crash the program we must write code that detects and handles them
Exceptions Topics:
	1. Exceptions Intro
	2. Checked & unchecked
	3. Try & Cacth
	4. Throws Keyword
			try&catch vs throw
	5. Throw keyword
			throws vs throw
	6. Custom Exception





final vs finalize vs finally:interview question

	final: keyword ==> unchangable

	finalize: method ===> GC use it to collect the objects that are eligible for garbage collection

	finally: block ===> can only used with try&catch


Null pointer exception: (uncheck exception) reference type decide you can call method or not but object type decide the implementation if its null it does not
get any error but but in tun time it will give expection

aritmetikException:(encheck) division operator 100/0 /by zero olmaz

RUNTYPE ARE ALL UNCHECK EXCPTION:bazilari
class cast, illegal argument(numberFormat), aritmetic, index out of bound(Stringindex, ArrayIndex), null pointer


COMPILE TIME EXCEPTION: iNTELJ ALWAYS TELL US WHAT IS IT,

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ERROR = Linkage Error, Virtual Machine Error (its system resources issue, they can not be recoverable. programers can not be detect, they are irricaverable)
 Virtual machine Error: OutOfMemoryError - StackOverFlowError

Error: Indicated an illigal operation is being perform
occurs during run time only
They can not be recoverd and not recommended to handle them
exception is recoverable
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to handle Exception:(check or unchecked)

TRY & CATCH BLOCKS:
its a solution for many exceptions, we only handle expection. they have to be together allthe time elseif  else gibi.

try: the code that giving exception goes in that block
catch: handle the exception if try block cant ( you give expection type, if not know RuntimeException) daha babalarini yazma runtime yeter
you can give multiple catch block but the rule is parent exception class can not be place before child exception
----------------------------------------------------------
e.printStackTrace() : this method display the full details of exception after the executing the program
mesela index out of bound oldu 4 indexli biseyeden 1000. indexi istedin yaziyor\
bu sadece in the catch block you can use it


getMessage(); : returns only brief description of the exception

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multi catch block, parent exception class can not be place before any of the catch block, and we give
runTimeException e  at the end of catch block. because if its not catch any on the upper catch block runtime will catch for sure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FINALLY BLOCK:
an optional block that can be given after last catch  block
as long as program is crused, terminatinate. forcefully terminated than it wont get executed
other wise it will always get executed

even thog exception not handle not catch final block will get executed still.
