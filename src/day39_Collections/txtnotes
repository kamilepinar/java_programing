Collections Framework

a group of interfaces and classes that define data structures that handle data differently.
    They define how data is added, or read from etc, based on different algorithms and implementations
Main interface of the framework
Iterable: parent of the Collection interface. Allows data structures to be iterated with a for each loop. Defines the iterator method

Collection: child of Iterable. The parent of the Collection types. Defines the main functions of a collection
    ex: add, remove, size

List: ordered(index), allows duplicates

Set: unordered(no indexes), not allow duplicates
    SortedSet: child of Set. has the idea of sorting

List: ordered(index), allowed duplicates

Queue: typically FIFO (First In First Out), but not necessarily(not always)

    null not allowed because there are additional methods defined that return null

    Deque: working with data from beginning and end of the collection
        Ex: methods: addFirst, removeLast()

Map: stores information using keys and values
    DOES NOT INHERIT THE COLLECTION INTERFACE, but still considered a part o
